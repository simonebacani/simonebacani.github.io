## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 3, Part 2
I’m going to say this lab was one of my favorites because I struggled with this one the most. It was still the beginning of the semester so me and my partner were having a hard time figuring out what to do. We met up twice after the initial lab day to try to figure it out. In the end, I was able to finish it and I felt this wave of accomplishment and joy wash over me. Honestly, it was one of the first times I’d felt something like that, so it was very memorable to me. :) 

Lab 6
I liked both parts of this lab because it was fun. The first part was an intro to vectors where we just made a sandwich. It was silly. Second part was coding Blackjack, which was slightly difficult, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. I always like the game creation ones.

Lab 5, Part 2
I enjoyed this part because we learned if loops, which I think is a great fundamental to know. It’s probably my favorite loop! It’s simple and straight-forward. The substance of this lab was not fun, but I enjoyed the learning aspect of it.
